This is a traction control strategy.  

The goal is to read in a front wheel speed sensor and a rear wheel speed sensor.  
We will take that data in real time and output a voltage to a pin that pulls timing.

This was built on a adafruit RP2040 Feather.

I have a companion script that will run as a simulator
